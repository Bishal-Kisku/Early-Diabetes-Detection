# Early-Diabetes-Detection
Diabetes is a horrible chronic disease that leads to a relatively lower quality of life, and can be life threatening if not diagnosed early. I worked with clinical data (extracted from UCI Repository) and trained a model to predict diabetes status in a patient.

Part 1 - Data collection and cleaning : Acquired and cleaned clinical data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Part 2 - Data Visualization and statistics : Performed statistical analysis and visualize the data using data visualization methods.

Part 3 - Machine learning model training : Trained a machine learning model using the data collected and cleaned. Then assessed the model by examining the feature importances.
